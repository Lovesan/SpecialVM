Special [Olympics] VM is a
    full-featured virtual 32 bit load/store RISC processor
    with some periphery(namely, terminal and disks), but without FPU.

See full description in SVM.c

Currently it is implemented for Windows(because of SVM Console),
    but Linux porters are welcome. It would be not to hard to rewrite
    SVMCon.c for e.g. ncurses.
